Hello Folks, 

I mostly prefer talking about technical things in my articles but todayâ€™s article is as important as all those technical skills! As a developer, the only thing which remains constant for us is continuous learning and while choosing this path we all have signed-up for this. Though most of the time we enjoy learning, there are times when this feels overwhelming, draining and demotivating. 

We all go through this at some point, but we hardly talk about this!

Itâ€™s been more than a year now that we have shifted to work from home culture. It made a huge shift in our daily routines, lifestyles and habits. But one major change it caused was taking less days off! Not only this, if you are someone like me, who is working on some [side-project](http://peerlist.io/), then this day off comes as a more opportunity to work and that is what I did for the past 6 months (not a single day off!ðŸ˜¨)

After this over working, I felt burned out! I posted this on twitter and the people around me taught me some really good tips to handle this in a better way.

In this article, I will be sharing those tips with you ðŸ˜‡

### First, letâ€™s understand why this happened?

Burnouts are mostly the outcome of overworking, I know this is a very basic thing, but we tend to avoid digging deep and not understanding the root cause. As a developer, all our work is done sitting at one place solving problems. We start working on one thing to another without switching in-between. This is the exact opposite of doing a physical activity, which looks more rewarding. 

If you are doing some physical activity, like walking, hiking or anything, you can easily measure your progress, as it is clearly visible. But while coding, if you have solved half the logic of your bug spending 4 hours on it, that doesnâ€™t look like progress! 

Here are some solutions to this - 

### Take breaks, spend some time without any screen!

Solution is, rewarding yourself with some free time after a small accomplishment! You may have a huge to-do, a prod deployment ahead or any urgent task, NEVER stop taking a break! This is the reason why pomodoro technique is so efficient. If you want to save draining yourself, you will need to take breaks and enjoy some free time away from the screen. This thing will be very helpful when you have a lot of work to do! 

I used to think, taking a break will waste my time and I will not be able to finish these tasks. But, practically, it calms you down giving you more energy to focus and finish tasks within time. We all know this, but we underestimate it a lot!


### Open up your creative side! 

Everyone has some hobby, some creative side of themselves. Give it some room. I was not doing any activity apart from coding and daily chores. That was a mistake. Because of continuous work, I was not giving myself time to reflect on the things happening around or even to understand something is going wrong with me. 

To understand this, to think through the situation, try working on some creative stuff. Draw, paint, knit, do anything, which will keep your mind idle yet feeling comfortable. 

 
### Practice mindfulness! 

I have this habit of planning things ahead of time. This helps me finish things, but it has a drawback of keeping me worried all the time. I used to take frequent breaks, but during those breaks, I used to plan my next activities. That way you still continue your work and the break doesn't remain a break! To stop this, you need to practice mindfulness. Being in the moment and not planning anything! This sounds little philosophical, but people like me who are obsessive planners will need to understand this! 

### Last and Most Important, Limit social media! 

You might think, this has nothing to do with burnout, but trust me it has! Social media is full of success stories, but out of those, very few people talk about the struggles. Social media always shows only the success without giving much focus on many lost attempts. Being on social media, we unknowingly compare our success with someone else and start to feel low! This makes you work more, without enjoying it and end up getting burnout!

Afterall, the ultimate aim is to enjoy doing what we are doing ðŸ¥°

I hope with these things in your mind, you might handle your burnouts better than me ðŸ˜… or at least save yourself from getting burned out! I would love to listen to your stories or ways of handling this, please share them in comments or message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ms_yogii)! 

In case, you are curious to know, I have been working on a side project for creating a single work profile. You can check that [here](https://peerlist.io/) and share your feedback about it. I would love to understand! 

Thank you so much for reading this article!
