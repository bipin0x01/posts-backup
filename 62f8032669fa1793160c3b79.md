### Definition

Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a **sorted array** by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(Log n).

### Comparsion

Binary Search Big O Notation is O(log n), Compared to Linear Search which Has Time Complexity of O(n).

Binary Search is able to search sorted arrays much faster than Linear Search.

### Real Life Example

I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 50, The answer is 1

#### Linear Search

Number = 50 ? No
Number = 49 ? No
...
Number = 2 ? No
Number = 1 ? Yes!

It takes 50 Guesses at Worst Case!

#### Binary Search

Number = 25 ? No, Less
Number = 12 ? No, Less
Number = 6 ? No, Less
Number = 3 ? No, Less
Number = 2 ? No, Less
Number = 1 ? Yes!

It takes 6 Guesses at Worst Case!

#### Conclusion

Assuming 1,000,000 Numbers!
Linear Search would result in a 1,000,000 Guesses (Worst Case)
Binary Search would result in a 20 Guesses (Worst Case)

### Coding

```
const binarySearch = (sortedArr, value) => {
  let left = 0;
  let right = sortedArr.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    const midVal = sortedArr[mid];

    if (midVal === value) {
      return mid;
    } else if (midVal < value) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  return -1;
};
```
